## Task:
Prepare a CLI tool to create a detailed report of running processes on a MacBook. This tool assesses your practical skills in developing portable, secure, and user-friendly utilities.

## Your CLI tool must:
1. Generate a Comprehensive Report:
- List running processes, including details such as process ID (PID), name, user, CPU usage, and memory usage.
- Output the report in an easily visualizable format (CSV or JSON).

2. Visualization:
- Document how the generated report can be visualized using readily accessible tools (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, or open-source visualization software).
- Include a sample visualization demonstrating metrics such as total running processes per user.

3. Portability and Ease of Use:
- Ensure the CLI tool can be executed from any directory (e.g., Downloads, Documents).
- Avoid external dependencies or provide clear, justified reasons if you choose to include any.

4. Documentation and CI Integration:
- Include a clear README file in your repository detailing installation, execution, example usage, and troubleshooting tips.
- Implement a simple Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar) that automatically checks the tool's basic functionality upon code changes.
